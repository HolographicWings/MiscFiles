I made this french translation with a natural language model and comparaison between https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/spells-5e.php and https://www.aidedd.org/dnd-filters/sorts.php.
So theres a lot of errors.
Anyone feel free to correct it.

To use :
- Download the file "5eSpells.loca" by clicking on it and click on "download raw file".
- Place the file "5eSpells.loca" in "\Baldurs Gate 3\Data\Localization\French".
- Restart the game.

To correct, edit "5eSpells.xml" and pull request.
I'll recompile the ".loca" as soon as possible.
