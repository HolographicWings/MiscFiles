I made this french translation with a natural language model.
Anyone feel free to correct it.

To use :
- Download the file "RingsExpanded.loca" by clicking on it and click on "download raw file".
- Place the file "RingsExpanded.loca" in "\Baldurs Gate 3\Data\Localization\French".
- Restart the game.

To correct, edit "RingsExpanded.xml" and pull request.
English XML and loca files are in parent parent then "English" folder.
I'll recompile the ".loca" as soon as possible.
